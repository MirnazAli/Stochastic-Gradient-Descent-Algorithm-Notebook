# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-Algorithm-Notebook
This Github repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning for training various models. The notebook is written in Python and uses popular scientific computing libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib.

In the notebook, you will find a step-by-step implementation of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which updates the model's parameters using a single training example at a time, making it much faster than batch gradient descent. The implementation includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including how to calculate the gradient and how to update the model parameters using stochastic gradient descent.

Additionally, the notebook provides an example of applying stochastic gradient descent to linear regression problem. You can follow along with the examples and see how stochastic gradient descent can be used to optimize the models' parameters and improve their performance.
